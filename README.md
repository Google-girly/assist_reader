# ASSIST Institution & Transfer Data Tools

This project contains small Python utilities for working with data from the
[ASSIST.org](https://www.assist.org) public API, including institution codes and
course transfer information.

## Files

- `get_institutions.py`  
  Fetches the ASSIST institutions API and generates a simplified list of
  schools with numeric institution codes.

- `school_codes.txt`  
  Output file generated by `get_institutions.py`.  
  Contains JSON objects in the format:
```json
  {
    "schoolName": "California Maritime Academy",
    "code": 1
  }
```

- `make_simple_transfers.py`  
  Processes ASSIST transfer data and generates a simplified transfer mapping.

- `simple_transfers.json`  
  Output produced by `make_simple_transfers.py`, containing cleaned and
  structured transfer results.

- `requirements.txt`  
  Python dependencies required to run the scripts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Generate school codes

Run:
```bash
python get_institutions.py
```

This will:
- Fetch institution data from ASSIST
- Extract the school name and numeric institution ID
- Write the results to `school_codes.txt` in the same directory

### Generate simplified transfer data

Run:
```bash
python make_simple_transfers.py
```

This will read ASSIST transfer data and output a simplified JSON file
(`simple_transfers.json`) for easier consumption.

## Notes

- `school_codes.txt` is valid JSON despite the `.txt` extension.
- Numeric code values correspond to ASSIST institution IDs.
- The scripts overwrite output files if they already exist.

## Disclaimer

This project uses publicly available ASSIST data and is not affiliated with
or endorsed by ASSIST.org. Data formats and endpoints may change.
